    <h1> David Bowie was an Alien God </h1>

    <p>
      Time may change me but I can't trace time.<br>
      For here, am I sitting in a tin can? Far above the world?<br>
      He played it left hand, but made it too far. Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's Band.<br>
      It's not the side-effects of a cocaine. I'm thinking that it must be love.<br>
      We live for just these twenty years. Do we have to die for the fifty more?<br>
      Look up here, I'm in heaven.
